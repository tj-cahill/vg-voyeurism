This script takes the cleaned output from the DATA_MERGE script and runs diagnostics and outputs univariate stats for the first part of the analysis, setting the groundwork for later hypothesis tests. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

First, we import the merged dataset.

```{r import}
readRDS(file = "data/merged_all.rds") -> vgv
```
