This script takes the cleaned output from the DATA_MERGE script and runs hypothesis tests and inductive stats for the second part of the analysis, following diagnostics and univariate states.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r import}
readRDS(file = "data/merged_all.rds") -> vgv
```
