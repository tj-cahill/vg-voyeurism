This script takes the cleaned output from the DATA_MERGE script and runs some exploratory data analysis, following hypothesis testing, to look at some of our additional research questions.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
readRDS(file = "data/merged_all.rds") -> vgv
readRDS(file = "data/Qualtrics_merged.rds") -> qualtrics
```
